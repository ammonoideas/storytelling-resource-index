      <h1>THE V&A MUSEUM COLLECTION</h1>
      <p>The Victoria and Albert Museum has an extensive digital archive of all the objects in their collection. You can filter the contents of the collection by date (800 B.C.E. to 2000 C.E.), object type (e.g. theater costume, print, design, photograph), and more to find all sorts of reference images. My personal favorite ways to use the collection are to find patterns and early 20th century costume designs for vis dev inspiration, but that's only scratching the surface of what this collection has to offer.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USAGE ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>I like to use the V&A's collection as a source of reference for fantasy and historically inspired visual development. It's helpful for designing outfits and props based on a particular setting in history. I find that museum collections tend to be more useful as sources of reference than Google or Pinterest because of their specificity of purpose and the context that comes with each object: you can know for sure that an object has been verified as being from, say, the 1920s, rather than having to take the word of whoever uploaded that image to the Internet.</p>
