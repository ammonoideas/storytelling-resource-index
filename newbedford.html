      <h1>THE NEW BEDFORD WHALING MUSEUM COLLECTION</h1>
      <p>The New Bedford Whaling Museum has many of its objects catalogued in its <a href="https://collections.whalingmuseum.org/RediscoveryProficioPublicSearch/Welcome.aspx" target="blank"> digital collections</a>. These objects are generally related to whaling, 19th century life, and the ocean, and they range from textiles to fine arts to manuscripts and more.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USAGE ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>I've found the New Bedford Whaling Museum's digital collections to be a good source of reference for visual development and research related to whaling and life in 19th century America. Many of the objects in the collection are from particular historical brands, which are fun to research and use as inspiration for vintage graphic design. I find that museum collections tend to be more useful as sources of reference than Google or Pinterest because of their specificity of purpose and the context that comes with each object: you can know for sure that an object has been verified as being from, say, the 1920s, rather than having to take the word of whoever uploaded that image to the Internet.</p>
