      <h1>UNIVERSAL MILLWORK DESIGN BOOK NO. 20</h1>
      <p>If you're looking for references for 1920s interior design, <i>Universal Millwork</i> has you covered. The book is a catalogue of different styles of doors, windows, blinds, etc. from 1920, which is useful for drawing and designing enironments from that time period.</p>
      <p>The contents of this book may not be front-and-center features of most artworks, but taking into account common design elements of the historical era from which you're drawing can really tie a space together. Sometimes it's the little details that make the biggest difference.</p>
