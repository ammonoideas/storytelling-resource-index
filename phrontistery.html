      <h1>THE PHRONTISTERY</h1>
      <p>The Phrontistery is a vast collection of all sorts of obscure and unusual words. The site contains glossaries on a variety of esoteric topics, such as "Carriages and Chariots" or "Units of Measurement". You can browse its <a href="https://phrontistery.info/clw.html" target="blank">Compendium of Lost Words</a> or the <a href="https://phrontistery.info/lipogram.html" target="blank">Loquacious Location of Lipograms</a> for endless word-related fun.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USAGE ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>The most obvious purpose for this site among the ranks of the storytelling resource index is as a source of interesting words for writing, but it's also a fun way to find unique names for a fantasy setting (or any setting, if you're brave enough). I haven't listed this under the "character" or "environment" tags because I don't consider this an overt enough function of the site, but I'm still on the fence about it.</p>
