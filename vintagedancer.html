      <h1>VINTAGE DANCER</h1>
      <p>Vintage Dancer is a website dedicated to historical fashion from the Victorian era through the 1990s. The site offers a general overview of the various styles of fashion from each decade, sorted by gender, by occasion (e.g. daywear, eveningwear), and by article of clothing (e.g. shirts, pants, dresses, sleepwear).</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USAGE ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>For a more in-depth understanding of historical fashion I would recommend looking beyond Vintage Dancer at more primary and secondary sources on the subject, but the site does have plenty of images from clothing catalogs from each time period and works great for getting a general understanding of the styles of each time period.</p>
