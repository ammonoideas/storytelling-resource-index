      <h1>ARCADIA.NET WORLDBUILDING CHECKLIST</h1>
      <p>This page contains a list of all the aspects of a fictional world, from technological level to cultural practices. Though it was conceived of as a tool for setting development in Dungeons and Dragons, the checklist itself works for any setting, be it urban fantasy, sci-fi, or any other kind of alternate universe.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USAGE ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>When I'm developing a new fictional setting, I use this checklist as a way to make sure I've covered all of my bases. The verisimilitude of a fictional world depends on how well all of its interlocking systems fit together, and this checklist is a good way to make sure there aren't any interesting narrative/worldbuilding opportunities you're missing out on.</p>
