      <h1>THE MET MUSEUM COLLECTION</h1>
      <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art has an extensive digital archive of all the objects in their collection. You can find illustrations, clothing, tools, and more all the way from 8000 B.C. to the present day.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USAGE ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>I like to use the Met's collection as a source of reference for fantasy and historically inspired visual development. It's helpful for designing outfits and props based on a particular setting in history. I find that museum collections tend to be more useful as sources of reference than Google or Pinterest because of their specificity of purpose and the context that comes with each object: you can know for sure that an object has been verified as being from, say, the 1920s, rather than having to take the word of whoever uploaded that image to the Internet.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† RELATED SITES ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>The Met Museum website also offers access to the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/watson-digital-collections" target="blank">Thomas J. Watson Library Digital Collections</a>, where you can browse collections dedicated to more specific topics like the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/watson-digital-collections/costume-institute-collections" target="blank">Costume Institute COllections</a> or even <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/watson-digital-collections/metropolitan-museum-of-art-publications" target="blank">the Met's own publications</a>, which I know I personally used to find old museum floor plans as reference material for a story about a museum heist set in the 1920s.</p>
