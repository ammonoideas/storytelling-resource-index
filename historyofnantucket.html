      <h1>THE HISTORY OF NANTUCKET</h1>
      <p><i>The History of Nantucket</i> was written by Obed Macy and published in the year 1835. It is an account of, you guessed it, the history of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, and a valuable secondary source for learning about the subject.</p>
      <p>Nantucket is historically known for its involvement in the history of American whaling, so much of the book's contents are dedicated to the subject. Macy covers a variety of topics related to Nantucket's whaling history, ranging from statistics about whaling life to the many industries on land that relied on whaling.</p>
