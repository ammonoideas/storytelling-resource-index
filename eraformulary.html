      <h1>THE ERA FORMULARY</h1>
      <p><i>The Era Formulary: 5000 Formulas for Druggists</i> is a book I came across during a visit to the <a href="https://www.whalingmuseum.org/">New Bedford Whaling Museum</a>, in their exhibit on whaling life. The book was displayed alongside a medicine chest, the kind that would typically be kept in the captain's quarters of a 19th century whaling vessel, and would have been used by the captain to aid in the application of the chest's other medicinal contents in treating a crewmember's medical woes.</p>
      <p>Published in 1893, <i>The Era Formulary</i> is a fascinating look at the types of medicine that would have been used during the time period. It would have likely been used in the context of pharmacies on land as well, and it's a good resource for if you're looking to write about everyday 19th century medical practices.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USAGE ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>You can use the contents of this book to learn about what sorts of medicines might be used to treat a certain ailment during the time period, as well as how that medicine would be prepared. Unlike the modern day, many of the substances employed did not come pre-prepared as medicine for a single purpose, so druggists at the time would have to mix the ingredients together themselves.</p>
      <p>If using this for visual purposes, you could look into the packaging a relevant ingredient might come in or what a certain mixing process actually looks like when performed in real life.</p>
