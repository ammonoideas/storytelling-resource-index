      <h1>ONLY YESTERDAY</h1>
      <p><i>Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties</i> was written by Frederick Lewis Allen and published in 1946. It's a recounting of what everyday life was like in 1920s America from the perspective and memory of someone living only two decades later, and it functions as a useful secondary source for learning about the time period.</p>
      <p>The book covers many of the key historical events of the 1920s along with their attendant cultural zeitgeists (for example: religion and business during Coolidge's term as president). Note that Allen writes from a particular perspective and positionality, so the experiences of certain demographics may not be represented in this book. Overall, though, <i>Only Yesterday</i> is a good way to get a sense of what was largely culturally relevant at the time.</p>
