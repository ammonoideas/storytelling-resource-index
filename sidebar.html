      <h2>ðŸŸ† ABOUT ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>Welcome to EX LIBRIS AMMONOIDEAS, my personal library for storytelling resources. Here I have collected all of the links I normally use in the process of character creation, writing, worldbuilding, and visual development in the hopes that others might find this useful as well.</p>
      <p>My main interests lie in the realms of fantasy, history (1890s-1940s mainly), and the aquatic, so the range of resources currently present in this index biases toward those subjects. The list will hopefully continue to grow as I expand my creative horizons in the future.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USING THE INDEX ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>You can filter the index contents on the left using the categories along the top of the page. Clicking on one of the links to the left will update this sidebar with information on the resource in question; you can then click on the sidebar image to visit the site itself.</p>
      <p>Clicking on the handy button at the bottom of this sidebar will take you back to this info page.</p>
