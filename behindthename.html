      <h1>BEHIND THE NAME</h1>
      <p>Behind the Name is a website with information on the meanings of all sorts of given names from across multiple cultures. It's useful for, you guessed it, naming characters, especially if you're interested in more varied cultural representation among your casts.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† USAGE ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>Depending on what culture you're looking on, you might want to use this site in different ways, potentially in conjunction with other resources as well. The site's format, for instance, is better suited to certain cultures than others: Chinese names, for example, are made up of combinations of words with different meanings, and consequently Behind the Name's practice of listing each and every individual name isn't as well suited to reflecting the ways Chinese names are constructed as it is to, say, English names. In cases like these, it's worth looking further into the way given names are constructed in the culture you're representing.</p>
      <p>The site also doesn't cover the full extent of the cultural context in which each name is used, so additional research may be required on this front as well. It's worth going on Wikipedia and looking up notable figures from the culture in question to get a sense of how realistic your prospective name choices are.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŸ† RELATED SITES ðŸŸ†</h2>
      <p>Behind the Name also has a site dedicated to surnames, which can be found at <a href="https://surnames.behindthename.com">surnames.behindthename.com</a>.</p>
